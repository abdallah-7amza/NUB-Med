# Dysmenorrhea (Painful Menstruation)

## Definition
Dysmenorrhea is the medical term for painful menstrual periods which are caused by uterine contractions.

---

## Types of Dysmenorrhea

### 1. Primary (Spasmodic) Dysmenorrhea
This is common menstrual cramping that is recurrent and is not due to other diseases. Pain usually begins 1 or 2 days before, or when menstrual bleeding starts, and is felt in the lower abdomen, back, or thighs.

### 2. Secondary (Congestive) Dysmenorrhea
This is pain that is caused by a disorder in the woman's reproductive organs, such as uterine fibroids, adenomyosis, or most commonly, endometriosis. The pain often gets worse over time and may start before the menstrual cycle begins and continue after it ends.

### 3. Endometriosis-Related Pain
A key feature of dysmenorrhea caused by endometriosis is a characteristic **crescendo-decrescendo** pattern, where the pain builds up, peaks, and then subsides. It often starts days before the period and can last throughout.

## Clinical Picture

### Patient Profile
- **Primary:** Typically begins within 6-12 months of menarche as ovulatory cycles are established. Common in adolescents and young women.
- **Secondary:** More common in women aged 30-45.

### Symptoms
- **Type of Pain:**
    - **Primary:** Spasmodic, crampy, colicky pain in the suprapubic area. May radiate to the back and inner thighs.
    - **Secondary:** Dull, continuous, aching pain that is felt deeper in the pelvis. It can be unilateral or bilateral.
- **Associated Symptoms:**
    - Nausea and vomiting
    - Headache, dizziness
    - Fatigue
    - Diarrhea

### Signs
- **General Examination:** Usually normal, may show signs of distress during a painful episode.
- **Abdominal Examination:** Suprapubic tenderness may be present, but typically no masses or guarding.
- **Pelvic (PV/PR/Bimanual) Examination:**
    - **Primary:** Usually completely normal between periods.
    - **Secondary:** May reveal underlying pathology such as a bulky uterus, adnexal mass, or uterosacral nodularity (suggestive of endometriosis).

## Investigations
Investigations are primarily done to confirm or exclude organic lesions, especially when secondary dysmenorrhea is suspected.
- **Pelvic Ultrasound:** To identify structural abnormalities like fibroids, ovarian cysts, or adenomyosis.
- **Laparoscopy:** The gold standard for diagnosing endometriosis or pelvic adhesions.
- **Hysteroscopy:** To investigate intrauterine pathology.

## Treatment

### 1. Primary (Spasmodic) Dysmenorrhea
- **NSAIDs (Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs):** First-line treatment. They work by inhibiting prostaglandin production. Examples: Ibuprofen, Naproxen.
- **COCPs (Combined Oral Contraceptive Pills):** Effective by suppressing ovulation and reducing menstrual flow.

### 2. Secondary (Congestive) Dysmenorrhea
- **Treatment of the underlying cause:**
    - **Endometriosis:** Medical (hormonal therapy) or surgical management.
    - **Fibroids:** Myomectomy or other interventions.
    - **Adenomyosis:** Hormonal treatment or hysterectomy.
