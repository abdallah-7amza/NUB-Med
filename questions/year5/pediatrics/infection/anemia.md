# Anemia in Children

Anemia is defined as a reduction in the hemoglobin (Hb) concentration or red blood cell (RBC) volume below the range of values occurring in healthy individuals.

## Classification

Anemia can be classified based on two main approaches:
1.  **Morphological Classification:** Based on the size of the RBCs (MCV - Mean Corpuscular Volume).
    -   Microcytic (Low MCV)
    -   Normocytic (Normal MCV)
    -   Macrocytic (High MCV)
2.  **Etiological Classification:** Based on the underlying cause.
    -   Decreased RBC production
    -   Increased RBC destruction (hemolysis)
    -   Blood loss

## Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA)

IDA is the most common type of anemia in children worldwide. It is a microcytic anemia caused by insufficient iron for hemoglobin synthesis.

### Clinical Features
-   Pallor (most common sign)
-   Fatigue and irritability
-   Pica (craving for non-nutritive substances like ice or dirt)
-   Koilonychia (spoon-shaped nails) in severe cases

### Diagnosis
-   **CBC:** Low Hb, Low MCV, Low MCH/MCHC. High RDW.
-   **Iron Studies:** Low serum iron, Low ferritin (most specific), High TIBC.

### Management
-   Oral iron supplementation (e.g., ferrous sulfate).
-   Dietary counseling.
-   Treat the underlying cause of iron deficiency.
