# Introduction to Antibiotics

Antibiotics are a type of antimicrobial substance active against bacteria. They are one of the most important types of antibacterial agents for fighting bacterial infections, and are widely used in the treatment and prevention of such infections.

## Main Classifications

There are several ways to classify antibiotics. The most common classifications are based on:

* Chemical structure (e.g., Beta-lactams, Macrolides).
* Mechanism of action (e.g., cell wall synthesis inhibitors).
* Spectrum of activity (broad-spectrum vs. narrow-spectrum).
