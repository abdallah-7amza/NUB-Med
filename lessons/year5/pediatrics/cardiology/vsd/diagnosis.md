# Diagnosis of Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)

The diagnosis of VSD is primarily based on clinical examination and confirmed with imaging studies.

## Physical Examination
- A characteristic **holosystolic murmur** is heard best at the left lower sternal border.
- The intensity of the murmur is inversely related to the size of the defect. A small VSD has a loud murmur.

## Investigations
1.  **Echocardiography (Echo):** This is the gold standard for diagnosis. It can visualize the defect, determine its size and location, and assess the hemodynamic consequences.
2.  **Chest X-ray (CXR):** May show cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascular markings in moderate to large VSDs.
3.  **Electrocardiogram (ECG):** Can show signs of ventricular hypertrophy.
