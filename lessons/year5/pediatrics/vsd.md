# Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)

A Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) is a hole in the interventricular septum, the wall that separates the right and left ventricles of the heart. It is the most common congenital heart anomaly.

## Pathophysiology

Due to the higher pressure in the left ventricle, a VSD allows oxygenated blood to shunt from the left ventricle to the right ventricle (left-to-right shunt). This increases pulmonary blood flow and can lead to pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy over time.

## Clinical Features

The presentation depends on the size of the defect:
-   **Small VSD:** Often asymptomatic. A loud, harsh, pansystolic murmur is heard at the lower left sternal border.
-   **Moderate to Large VSD:** Symptoms of heart failure in infancy, such as tachypnea, poor feeding, and failure to thrive. A less harsh murmur and a diastolic rumble may be heard.

## Diagnosis
-   **Echocardiography:** The gold standard for diagnosis. It can visualize the defect, determine its size, and assess the shunt's hemodynamic significance.
-   **Chest X-ray:** May show cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascular markings in large VSDs.
-   **ECG:** May show left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) or biventricular hypertrophy (BVH).
